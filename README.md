This was a Challenge to see if i could do an Infinite Scroll with a call to a dummy API for NFT.

It has a simple Header and style, because that wasnt the main focus of the project.

Altho i made it responsive for PC, Tablet(768px) and Phone(425px).

I has a Custom Hook that calls the Api to bring 20 images at a time, and adds 20 more each time you reach the bottom.

It also has a Spinner Loader for when its loading the 20 new images.

In Pc it has a grid of 3 columns, it goes to 2 columns on Tablet(768px), and finally 1 column on Phones(425px).
